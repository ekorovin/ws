		<h2>Taking IAM to an entirely new level</h2>
		<p>
			Identity has become the new security perimeter. It's the glue that “protects and connects” – protecting sensitive information while connecting the right people with the right set of data and services. Ensuring the security and availability of your Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems has become mission-critical.</p>
            
		<p>But this is no small challenge. The typical IAM environment is a hodgepodge of legacy systems, on-premise solutions from multiple vendors, and cloud-based components. A large corporation may have dozens of identity stores and loosely coupled IAM systems, the result of mergers and acquisitions or through the independent initiatives of multiple lines of business.

    	<h3>The Simeio Identity Intelligence Center<sup>TM</sup> (IIC).</h3>
		<p>Simeio IIC is the first and only solution of its kind designed to specifically to operate, monitor and defend complex, multi-vendor IAM infrastructures, and to leverage those infrastructures to deliver actionable business intelligence. It's a powerful combination of cutting-edge and proprietary IAM technologies backed by a team of highly skilled professionals.</p>

    	<h3>Filling a Critical Gap in Heterogeneous Environments</h3>
		<p>Simeio IIC provides an abstraction layer between your IAM infrastructure and the functions required to manage and monitor that infrastructure. This can dramatically simplify day-to-day operations by providing a single, consistent view of your IAM systems regardless of the complexity of the underlying IAM technologies, including multi-vendor on-premise environments, cloud-based solutions or a hybrid of the two.</p>
		<p>Simeio IIC fills a critical gap between the functions of a Network Operations Center (NOC) and a Security Operations Center (SOC). It goes beyond the monitoring of networks, servers, web sites and applications to include identities – not just the health of the systems that support them but also how those identities are being used (or misused).</p>

    	<h3>Enhanced Visibility and Security</h3>
		<p>Simeio IIC is designed to help anticipate disruptive events – not just operational vulnerabilities and inefficiencies such as server failures or bottlenecks, but also security risks tied to identity. Using proprietary identity profiling, for example, Simeio IIC can detect anomalies such as ghost accounts that are typically difficult to discover, especially in multi-vendor environments.</p>

		<p>As an identity administrator, you're often called upon to provision users with secure, anywhere, anytime access on their mobile devices. The irony is that you needed to be onsite to do it  – that is, until now. Simeio's POssO iPhone app lets you manage Open AM-based infrastructures remotely, including the Simeio Business-Ready IAM Cloud. Search, create and manage identities, reset passwords, manage roles, administer policies, and more.</p>

    	<h2>Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
		<p>Multi-factor authentication enhances transaction security by requiring additional components beyond a simple username and password. The concept of multi-factor authentication is usually explained in terms of requiring "something you have, something you know, or something you are" in order to be authenticated.</p>
        
        <p>Equally important to enhancing the security of any system is ensuring you aren't complicating or diminishing the user experience.  Simeio Advanced Authentication as a Service satisfies both of these requirements in a single solution by allowing administrators to quickly enable multi-factor authentication challenges such as out-of-band one-time passwords, virtual pattern security grids, or typing pattern recognition. </p>
