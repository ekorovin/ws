    <h1>Simeio Solutions Included in Cloud-Based IAM Sourcing Report by Independent Research Firm</h1>
    
<p><strong>Hoboken, NJ – November 1, 2012</strong> – Simeio Solutions, provider of a comprehensive suite of enterprise Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources designed to offer a fully integrated solution, has been included in a September 2012 report from Forrester Research, Inc., entitled “Source Your Identity and Access Management Capabilities” with the subtitle “Build/Buy Capabilities: The Identity and Access Management Playbook.”</p>
<p>The report looks at cloud-based IAM as a potentially cost-effective alternative in four categories:</p>
<p>• IAM for SaaS that allows users to access and manage cloud-based business applications<br />
• IAM as SaaS that moves provisioning into the cloud<br />
• IAM to SaaS that integrates on-premises IAM solutions with SaaS business applications<br />
• Federation broker networks that align partners in a federated IAM network</p>
<p>Simeio is shown as active in all of the first three categories.</p>
<p>The report also offers a self-assessment tool to assist security and risk professionals in weighting and quantifying several criteria to help guide a buy/build decision for the most effective cloud-based IAM solution.</p>
<p>“Cloud-based IAM can offer significant advantages in situations where capital resources or internal staffing is limited vs. an on-premises implementation,” said Simeio Solutions Managing Partner Hemen Vimadalal. “We are pleased to have been included in this valuable Forrester Research report and applaud them for developing a tool for helping to evaluate which cloud-based approach may be the best fit.”</p>

The company’s single-source approach to IAM encompasses managed services (both on-premise and remotely managed), cloud-based identity-as-a-service, and professional services that ensure on-target, smooth and cost-effective system design and implementation.</p>
