    <h1>Simeio Solutions Completes SOC 2 Type 1 Examination and Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Control Matrix Examination</h1>

<p><strong>HOBOKEN, NJ — Jan 8, 2014</strong> — Simeio Solutions, a leading a provider of identity administration and access management, is pleased to announce that it has recently completed an SOC 2 examination and independent examination against the Cloud Security Alliance&#8217;s Cloud Controls Matrix for its Identity Access Management Services system. Both examinations were performed by a nationally recognized independent audit and compliance firm, and were completed in November 2013. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have made significant financial and operational investment in this industry best-practice examination to support both our long-term business and technology strategy to provide our customers trusted services from our industry-leading Business Ready IAM Cloud Platform,&#8221; said Hemen Vimadalal, Simeio Solutions, CEO. &#8220;The SOC 2 examination allows us to transparently communicate our level of controls to our customers&#8217; senior management teams. It is one more way of insuring that our internal controls meet published best practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to complete the examinations, Simeio Solutions management identified control policies and procedures designed to achieve the AICPA / CICA Trust Services Criteria for the Security principle, in addition to aligning with the applicable control specifications within version 3 of Cloud Security Alliance&#8217;s Cloud Control Matrix. </p>
<p>Simeio Solutions&#8217; service auditor performed extensive testing of the design and implementation of our control activities to help ensure the applicable Trust Service security criteria and CCM control specifications were addressed. For the SOC 2 examination, the service auditor&#8217;s testing allowed the service auditor to opine on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Our description fairly presents the Identity Access Management services system that was designed and implemented as of the examination date; and</li>
<li> Our controls were suitably designed to achieve the Trust Services criteria for the Security principle as of November 30, 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>For the CCM attestation, the service auditor&#8217;s testing allowed the service auditor to opine on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Our description fairly presents the Identity Access Management services system that was designed and implemented as of the examination date; and</li>
<li> Our control activities align with the applicable control specifications within the CSA CCM</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these rigorous examinations, the independent auditing firm was able to issue an affirmative (&#8220;unqualified&#8221;) opinion regarding the areas described above.</p>
<p>&#8220;After this comprehensive review of the company&#8217;s controls in critical areas such as confidentiality, availability, and privacy,&#8221; said Paresh Patel, Simeio Solutions, CTO, &#8220;Simeio&#8217;s customers gain comfort and peace of mind from the services provided and can be more confident about our services. Simeio is committed to delivering a secure, robust solution to our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simeio Solutions management recognizes the importance of security and effective controls and the reliance placed on those controls by our valued business partners. The SOC 2 and CSA CCM attestation reports are designed to provide clients with a certain level of assurance regarding the controls that are maintained by Simeio Solutions management. The SOC 2 report addresses all five components of internal control outlined in the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, namely the control environment, risk assessment activities, control activities, information and communication systems, and monitoring activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Simeio Solutions&#8217; management understands the ever-increasing importance of corporate governance, as well as the impact of the organization&#8217;s services on our clients&#8217; system of internal controls. The successful completion of the 2013 SOC 2 and CSA CCM attestation are only part of Simeio Solutions&#8217; continued commitment to maintaining a high level of internal control. Simeio Solutions has engaged an independent service provider for multi-year examinations and will undergo a Type 2 SOC 2 examination on an annual basis.</p>
