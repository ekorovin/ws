  <h4>Simeio Solutions Receives Honorable Mention for Security and Identity Management in 2011 Oracle North America Titan Awards</h4>
<p>HOBOKEN, NJ&#8211;(Marketwire &#8211; Oct 12, 2011) &#8211; Simeio Solutions (<a href="http://www.simeiosolutions.com/">www.simeiosolutions.com</a>), an Oracle Gold Partner, has received an Honorable Mention in the 2011 Oracle North America Titan Awards for the second year in a row. Simeio&#8217;s flagship DirectAxs SaaS solution was awarded the Honorable Mention in the Security and Identity Management Solution category. Oracle North America Titan Awards are given by Oracle to its leading partners in recognition of their solutions and business practices developed or delivered in fiscal year 2011. The Titan Awards ceremony took place during Oracle OpenWorld.</p>
<p>DirectAxs has been one of the standouts in the fast-growing cloud-based IAM industry. It combines essential identity and access management (IAM) and governance, risk and compliance (GRC) capabilities into one hosted package that can be deployed in a fraction of the time and cost than that of a traditional implementation. Simeio also recently established a separate Identity and Access Intelligence practice in 2011 to address the convergence of IAM with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM).</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a source of pride to have our DirectAxs SaaS offering validated by the Oracle North America Titan Awards,&#8221; said Hemen Vimadalal, CEO, Simeio Solutions. &#8220;Just a few months ago, Simeio Solutions became one of only a few companies in the world to hold the Oracle Identity Administration and Analytics Specialization, which further demonstrates our expertise and success in the space. We have also signed several multi-year contracts with new enterprise customers who recognize that DirectAxs will reduce their identity and access management expenses, as well as the complexity of their identity infrastructures.&#8221;</p>

These awards honor customers for their cutting-edge solutions using Oracle Fusion Middleware products. Simeio&#8217;s client was recognized for its identity management project, which targeted headquarters and field office staff of approximately 6,000 users and further demonstrated Simeio&#8217;s expertise in the Oracle space. The company determined that Simeio&#8217;s SaaS solution would best fits their needs.</p>
