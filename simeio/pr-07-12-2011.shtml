"The fact that we are one of only a handful of companies in the world with Oracle's Identity Administration and Analytics Specialization truly validates the results we've been able to produce for our clients, many of whom represent the Fortune 50. Customer references played a significant part in achieving specialization, and that in itself is one of the greatest honors we could hope to achieve." </p>
