    <h1>SIMEIO SOLUTIONS DELIVERS SUPERIOR MANAGEMENT, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY IN NEW DELL ONE IDENTITY-AS-A-SERVICE (IDAAS) SOLUTION</h1>

    
<p><strong>Hoboken, NJ &ndash; November 4, 2014</strong> : Simeio Solutions today announced that it will host, integrate and manage the new Dell One Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution, which offers Dell’s most popular, enterprise-level identity and access management (IAM) technologies in an ‘as-a-Service’ format./p>


<p>Dell One Identity-as-a-Service leverages Simeio’s IAM expertise, as well as Simeio’s Business-Ready IAM Cloud [link to https://www.simeiosolutions.com/home/business-ready-iam-cloud.html], a secure, reliable and feature-rich platform designed to free businesses from the cost and distraction of maintaining their own IAM infrastructure.</p>

<p>With Simeio Business-Ready IAM Cloud, Dell One Identity-as-a-Service customers get all the capabilities of Dell’s powerful identity and access management software for provisioning, governance and access control, but without the large up-front investment in hardware and software, or ongoing maintenance and upgrade costs.</p>

<p>Dell One Identity-as-a-Service customers also enjoy the features and capabilities of the Simeio Identity Intelligence Center™ (IIC) [link to https://www.simeiosolutions.com/home/simeio-iic.html], the first and only solution of its kind designed specifically to operate, monitor and defend complex, multi-vendor IAM and security infrastructures.</p>

<p>Simeio IIC™ is designed to help anticipate disruptive events – operational vulnerabilities and inefficiencies, as well as security risks tied to identity – before they become problems. Simeio IIC™ goes even further by offering insights into how accounts are being used – or misused – and analytics that can help identify new business opportunities.</p>

<p>Simeio Solutions CEO Hemen Vimadalal said, “We recognize Dell’s leadership when it comes to delivering a comprehensive IAM solution, and we are pleased to partner with an industry leader to offer a full-featured Identity-as-a-Service solution to organizations that typically struggle to address IAM needs. The Simeio Business-Ready IAM Cloud delivered via the industry's first and only Identity Intelligence Center, provides our clients with a higher level of security and reliability.”</p>

<p>John Milburn, executive director, Identity and Access Management, Dell Software, added, “With this strong expansion into the SaaS market, Dell is offering under-served companies the ability to do IAM the right way. Unlike other SaaS-based IAM offerings that focus on just provisioning, governance or access control, we don’t limit our customers to such a narrow scope  – we offer it all, as we believe that addressing the full range of needs is the best way to implement a truly effective IAM strategy. Partnering with Simeio to deliver such a solution, we know that our customers will get all the security and reliability they demand.”</p>
