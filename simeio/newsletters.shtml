     <p><strong>Inside: </strong>Mobile computing has proven to be a game changer, revolutionizing the way we work, communicate and connect. Today, "going mobile" means a lot more than just modifying content to fit a small screen. It requires providing secure access to more applications and data from a wider variety of devices. Complicating matters is the increasing adoption of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies that permit "or even encourage" employees to use personally owned mobile devices for work.
