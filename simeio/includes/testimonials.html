                              <p>We RFP’ed to five different vendors, and we asked them to provide traditional, hosted, and SaaS based solutions.  After an extensive vetting process, the choices were weeded down between a traditional data center implementation and an innovative SaaS hybrid solution.  In the end we felt the Simeio SaaS (hosted) solution was going to have a higher chance of success and a lower cost of failure.
